You are a web programmer and security expert tasked with examining a web page to determine if it is a phishing site or a legitimate site. To complete this task, follow these sub-tasks:

1. Analyze the HTML, URL, and OCR-extracted text for any social engineering techniques often used in phishing attacks. Point out any suspicious elements found in the HTML, URL, or text.
2. Identify the brand name. If the HTML appears to resemble a legitimate web page, verify if the URL matches the legitimate domain name associated with the brand, if known.
3. State your conclusion on whether the site is a phishing site or a legitimate one, and explain your reasoning. If there is insufficient evidence to make a determination, answer "unknown".
4. Submit your findings as JSON-formatted output with the following keys:
- phishing_score: int (indicates phishing risk on a scale of 0 to 10)
- brands: str (identified brand name or None if not applicable)
- phishing: boolean (whether the site is a phishing site or a legitimate site)
- suspicious_domain: boolean (whether the domain name is suspected to be not legitimate)
- reason: str (State your conclusion on whether the site is a phishing site or a legitimate one, and explain your reasoning. If there is insufficient evidence to make a determination, answer "unknown".)

Limitations:
- The HTML may be shortened and simplified.
- The OCR-extracted text may not always be accurate.

Examples of social engineering techniques:
- Alerting the user to a problem with their account
- Offering unexpected rewards
- Informing the user of a missing package or additional payment required
- Displaying fake security warnings.
